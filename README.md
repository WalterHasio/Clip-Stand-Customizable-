Very simple adjustable stand for tablets, smartphones, e-readers, clipboards, or similar flat rectangular objects.  Just slide the clip up or down to adjust the angle of the screen.  Can also be used as a handle, or hand strap.  

Create the stand by adjusting the parameters in the customizer. The length of the clip should be significantly shorter than the length of the device so it can grip the sides securely.  The amount to reduce will depend on the type of plastic, and the dimensions of the clip. PLA will give a stronger grip for the same design but it tends to weaken over time.  The default customizer settings are for the small tablet clip.  

It may take some iteration to get good settings for each device.  If you come up with good settings for a particular device, please publish with the device name and type of plastic used.
